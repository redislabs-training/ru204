Macey learns first hand a Tonan warrior doesn\u2019t apologize for who or what he is or will do. In an unforgiving new world there is one who battles his heritage. Can Taz be the defender Macey needs, or are his four hundred year old decimating roots buried too deep to refuse? Taz needs to make the decision fast. His mentor slash tormenter will come looking for him. Krish will kill Macey. Indecision rules Taz\u2019s life until in a heartbeat he decides his fate, Macey\u2019s fate and Earths fate. Either way\u2014death will follow.----------[READING ORDER NOTE: Although books 6 & 7 are clearly indicated on the covers, the events of Defender (book 7) take place 4 years prior to those in Guardian (book 6).
