A man thirsting for vengeance.A place where darkness and desire meet...As night falls, Claire Roth flees, driven from her home by a fiery threat that seems to come from hell itself.

For Claire is the one woman Andreas should not crave, and the only one he\u2019s ever loved. A dangerous seduction begins\u2014one that blurs the lines between predator and prey, and stokes the flames of a white-hot passion that may consume all in its path. . . .",
