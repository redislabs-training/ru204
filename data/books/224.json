    "description": "Book 7 in the Cyborg Seduction series. Krell hates humans. They left him scarred and undesirable to females. He\u2019s lived a lonely existence in his home world because of their brutality. So he\u2019s angry when he\u2019s ordered to interrogate the captured human. She\u2019s the enemy, a soldier from Earth. He\u2019ll show her the same mercy they showed him. None. Cyan didn\u2019t expect to survive her mission against the Markus Models but she\u2019s stunned and elated to be confronted by cyborgs. The past and present collide, however, when she sees Krell. He\u2019s part of a dangerous secret from another life\u2014and he\u2019s also completely irresistible. Krell is certain Cyan can\u2019t be trusted. He\u2019s determined to keep her at a distance\u2026but Cyan is just as determined to get the big, sexy cyborg into her bed.",
