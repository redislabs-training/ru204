At first she\u2019s terrified of her tall, muscled abductor, especially when he doesn\u2019t hesitate to quell her struggle for freedom with a little corporal discipline. After all her methods and ploys to escape fail, she decides to seduce her way to freedom.But out of seduction and subterfuge grow a true intimacy that cause Marlix and Tara to take action that drives Parseon to the brink of civil war, and threatens not only their relationship, but also their lives.Terran, the second book in the Breeder sci-fi series, is a \u201ccapture\u201d romance involving a domineering but hunky alien, a female with a bad dye job and an even worse attitude, explicit sex, anal sex, and spanking.",
