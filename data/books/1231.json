    "description": "To save his daughter, he\u2019ll go anywhere\u2014and any-when\u2026Kin Stewart is an everyday family man: working in IT, trying to keep the spark in his marriage, struggling to connect with his teenage daughter, Miranda. But his current life is a far cry from his previous career\u2026as a time-traveling secret agent from 2142.Stranded in suburban San Francisco since the 1990s after a botched mission, Kin has kept his past hidden from everyone around him, despite the increasing blackouts and memory loss affecting his time-traveler\u2019s brain. Until one afternoon, his \u201crescue\u201d team arrives\u2014eighteen years too late.Their mission: return Kin to 2142, where he\u2019s only been gone weeks, not years, and where another family is waiting for him. A family he can\u2019t remember.Torn between two lives, Kin is desperate for a way to stay connected to both. But when his best efforts threaten to destroy the agency and even history itself, his daughter\u2019s very existence is at risk. It\u2019ll take one final trip across time to save Miranda\u2014even if it means breaking all the rules of time travel in the process.A uniquely emotional genre-bending debut, Here and Now and Then captures the perfect balance of heart, playfulness, and imagination, offering an intimate glimpse into the crevices of a father\u2019s heart and its capacity to stretch across both space and time to protect the people that mean the most.",
