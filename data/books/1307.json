    "description": "Lyra's Oxford begins with Lyra and Pantalaimon spotting a witch's d\u00e6mon. Lyra shelters the daemon from the pursuit of a frenzied pack of birds, and then attempts to help by guiding the daemon to the home of an alchemist living in a part of Oxford known as Jericho. The journey through Oxford reveals more dangers than Lyra had anticipated.",
