A Horde King of the Dakkari, a merciless barbaric race, bred for war and violence, that rule over the hostile and unforgiving planet of Dakkar.And this Horde King? He\u2019s the most ruthless and insane of them all\u2014with his scarred face, glowing red eyes, and his wicked, dark grin that hides an even darker past.I am no one. I am quiet, meek, and fearful\u2026and yet this fearsome king wants me in his furs.
