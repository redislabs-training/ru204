As long as Time Lords existed, the Kin would be trapped forever and the universe would be safe. They had planned for everything\u2026 everything, that is, other than the Time War and the fall of Gallifrey. Now the Kin are free again and there\u2019s only one Time Lord left in the universe who can stop them!",
