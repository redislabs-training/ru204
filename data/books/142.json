    "description": "The Galactic Alliance\u2019s most important negotiator, Jathan One-Moon, is responsible for ensuring the yearly negotiations with the Ankylos are successful. If he fails and the Ankylos go to war, the human race will likely be exterminated. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, he\u2019s under pressure to marry and produce an heir. When he mistakes the brothel owner, Kazha Deinos, for his escort prior to the negotiations, the resulting evening makes Jathan realize his life is missing a man who can be a true partner to him.Kaz never met his most important client, and Jathan\u2019s misconception allows Kaz the freedom to give in to desires he\u2019s never let himself indulge in before. But Kaz has a business to run, one that a rival is trying to steal, which will force him to reveal his true identity to Jay. There\u2019s also the little issue of Jathan\u2019s impending marriage. Kaz is not interested in being a boy on the side of Jay\u2019s marriage, no matter how much he\u2019s come to care for Jathan. Will Jathan and Kaz find a way to be together, or will losing the man Jathan\u2019s grown to love be yet another price he must pay for saving the human race?32,900 words",
