She serves pasta with sausage, blue fruit juice, and dead acid flies on request. And she comes from another world. Ours.  It\u2019s a bad day when Erin finds herself transported to a fantastical world and nearly gets eaten by a Dragon. She doesn\u2019t belong in a place where monster attacks are a fact of life, and where Humans are one species among many. But she must adapt to her new life. Or die.  In a dangerous world where magic is real and people can level up and gain classes, Erin Solstice must battle somewhat evil Goblins, deadly Rock Crabs, and hungry [Necromancers]. She is no warrior, no mage. Erin Solstice runs an inn.  She\u2019s an [Innkeeper].",
