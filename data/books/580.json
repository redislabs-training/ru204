    "description": "By the end of the 30th century humanity has the capability to travel the universe, to journey beyond earth and beyond the confines of the vulnerable human frame.The descendants of centuries of scientific, cultural and physical development divide into three: fleshers \u2014 true Homo sapiens; Gleisner robots \u2014 embodying human minds within machines that interact with the physical world; and polises \u2014 supercomputers teeming with intelligent software, containing the direct copies of billions of human personalities now existing only in the virtual reality of the polis.Diaspora is the story of Yatima \u2014 a polis being created from random mutations of the Konishi polis base mind seed \u2014 and of humankind, Of an astrophysical accident that spurs the thousandfold cloning of the polises. Of the discovery of an alien race and of a kink in time that means humanity \u2014 whatever form it takes \u2014 will never again be threatened by acts of God.",
