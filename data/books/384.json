But life in the future does have its plus points - although not for long.A problem with the Time Map reveals chaos in the 16th century and the wrong Tudor queen on the throne. History has gone rogue, there's a St Mary's team right in the firing line and Max must step up.You know what they say. Hope for the best. But plan for the worst.",
