    "description": "Aliens exist, the government knows, and Dan McCarthy just found the proof.  When Dan McCarthy stumbles upon a folder containing evidence of the conspiracy to end all conspiracies -- a top-level alien cover-up -- he leaks the files without a second thought.  The incredible truth revealed by Dan\u2019s leak immediately captures the public\u2019s imagination, but Dan\u2019s relentless commitment to exposing the cover-up and forcing disclosure quickly earns him some enemies in high places.  For his whole life, Dan McCarthy has searched for a reason to believe. Now that he finally has one, he might soon wish he didn\u2019t...   Not Alone is a standalone tale of contact and disclosure for the 21st century. [approx. 850 pages]",
