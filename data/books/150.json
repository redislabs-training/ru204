    "description": "All Thomas Weaver wanted was death. What he got was time travel.  Thomas Weaver, haunted by a teenage tragedy, lived a wasted life. He closed his eyes for what he believed was the last time in 2016, but opened them again in his teenage bedroom and body in 1976. Now a middle-aged man in his teenage body, he sets out to fix everything he did wrong in his first life. A budding serial killer in home room, a possible new romance, and high school algebra complicate his plans.  What would you do, if you could do it all again?  The second Middle Falls Time Travel Novel - The Redemption of Michael Hollister - is now available. The third book in the series - The Death and Life of Dominick Davidner - is available on presale and will be published in December 2017.",
