    "description": "\n\n\nShe made a deal with the Dakkari devil!\n\n\n\nNow, he owns her!\n\n\nOn the unforgiving planet of Dakkar, I did what all the humans in our village did: kept my head down, worked to provide for my family, and I certainly didn\u2019t break any Dakkari laws to risk inciting the alien race\u2019s merciless wrath!\nUnfortunately, the same couldn\u2019t be said for my brother and one careless mistake brings a horde of the nomadic, barbarian Dakkari straight to our doorstep, led by their powerful horde king - a cold, ruthless, battle-scarred warrior demanding retribution!\n\n\nIn order to save my brother\u2019s life, I do the unthinkable...\n\n\nI sell myself to the horde king as his war prize. I agree to warm his furs, to travel with his horde across the wild lands of Dakkar, and to never see my family again!\n\n\nBut, as I struggle with my new reality, I discover that the surly, mysterious, dominant horde king never intended for me to be his concubine\u2026 \n\n\n\n\nHe wants me as his queen!\n\n\n",
