And there\u2019s another problem: A group, lurking in the darkness of space, playing human and alien against each other\u2014and against their own kind \u2014for their own unknown reasons.\u3000In this collapsing universe, CDF Lieutenant Harry Wilson and the Colonial Union diplomats he works with race against the clock to discover who is behind attacks on the Union and on alien races, to seek peace with a suspicious, angry Earth, and keep humanity\u2019s union intact...or else risk oblivion, and extinction\u2014and the end of all things.",
