<p>In this hands-on exercise we'll explore the capabilities of JSONPath projections when querying our index of book documents.</p>
<p>Let's retrieve the <span class="code">title</span>, <span class="code">description</span>, and <span class="code">year_published</span> of all books by the author Neil Gaiman. Let&apos;s rename <span class="code">description</span> as <span class="code">about_the_book</span> and <span class="code">year_published</span> as <span class="code">release_year</span> in our result set.</p>
<p><pre class="code">
FT.SEARCH index:bookdemo "@author:Neil Gaiman" RETURN 7 title $.description AS about_the_book $.year_published AS release_year LIMIT 0 3
</pre></p>
<p>Redis returns a result set containing ten books written by Neil Gaiman. Each result includes the book title, the <span class="code">description</span> (as <span class="code">about_the_book</span>) and <span class="code">year_published</span> (as <span class="code">release_year</span>). To keep the response short, we&apos;ve paginated the result set using <span class="code">LIMIT 0 3</span>:</p>

<p>Let&apos;s look up the inventory of the book "The Dark Is Rising" by Susan Cooper. We should search for this exact title, as many books have the word Dark in the title. For an exact string search, use parenthesis around the title:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
FT.SEARCH index:bookdemo "@title:(The Dark Is Rising)" RETURN 1 $.inventory
</pre></p>
<p>Redis returns the entire array of inventory objects for the book.</p>
<p><pre class="code">

2) "ru204:book:2492"
3) 1) "$.inventory"
   2) "[{\"status\":\"maintenance\",\"stock_id\":\"2492_1\"}]"

<p>Let&apos;s see all of the different editions of the books written by P J Manney. Let&apos;s also change the name of <span class="code">editions</span> to <span class="code">languages_offered</span> in our result set:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
FT.SEARCH index:bookdemo "@author:P J Manney" RETURN 5 author title $.editions AS languages_offered

<p>Let&apos;s search for books with the tag "mystery (detective)" and "thriller" and display their title and rating scores:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
FT.SEARCH index:bookdemo "@genres:{mystery \\(detective\\)} @genres:{thriller}" RETURN 4 title $..score AS rating
</pre></p>
<p>We are using the recursive operator <span class="code">..</span> to access the field score inside the metrics subdocument. We're also using the implicit AND between to genres queries to look for both tags within the same document. Redis returns 3 documents that have both such tags:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
1) "3"
2) "ru204:book:1299"
3) 1) "title"
   2) "World of Trouble"
